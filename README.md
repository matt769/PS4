Arduino library for using the data from the PS4 controller obtained via https://www.hobbytronics.co.uk/usb-host-board-v24
Refactoring of code provided here: https://www.hobbytronics.co.uk/ps3-ps4-controller-bluetooth

Note that Serial output must be turned off in USB host (see link above) to receive 'good' data via i2c.

See example sketch for use.
